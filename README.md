A basic login screen for my ecommerce app. 
It is a layout file made up of an ImageView that shows the app logo, 
two EditText Views for user phone number and password and
two Button Views for signing in(if user has account) and signing up(if user doesnt have an account.
The buttons dont do anything when clicked.
